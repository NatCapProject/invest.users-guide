Introduction
============

While there is a user interface for all the InVEST models, we also provide a Python application programming interface (API) for it.  This includes the main entry points for the InVEST ecosystem service models, and our underlying high performance geoprocessing and routing pipeline.  At the moment the documentation is limited, but we do support the installation of the API standalone through our Bitbucket Wiki site: https://bitbucket.org/natcap/invest-natcap.invest-3/wiki/Scripting%20InVEST%20on%20Windows 

This documentation will be updated in more detail in the future.  Programming support is also available on our user forums: http://forums.naturalcapitalproject.org/.
