Name,Description,Type
Precipitation Directory,Folder containing 12 maps of monthly precipitation for each pixel,"Folder of 12 rasters. Units: millimeters. Raster names must end with the month number (e.g. Precip_1.tif.) Only .tif files should be in this folder (no .tfw, .xml, etc files)"
ET0 Directory,Folder containing 12 maps of monthly reference evapotranspiration for each pixel,"Folder of 12 rasters. Units: millimeters. Raster names must end with the month number (e.g. ETo_1.tif) Only .tif files should be in this folder (no .tfw, .xml, etc files)"
Digital Elevation Model,Map of elevation for each pixel ,Raster of integer or floating point values. Units: meters.
Land-use/Land-cover,Map of land use/land cover (LULC) class for each pixel. All values in this raster must have corresponding entries in the Biophysical table.,"Raster of integers, where each unique integer represents a different land use/land cover class"
Soil group,"Map of SCS soil hydrologic groups (A, B, C, or D), used in combination with the LULC map to compute the curve number (CN) map.","Raster of integers. Values are entered as numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, corresponding to groups A, B, C, and D, respectively."
AOI/Watershed,Shapefile delineating the boundary of the watershed to be modeled,"Shapefile (can be polyshape.) The column ws_id is required, with a unique integer value for each polygon."
Biophysical table,Table containing:,**NOTE: All LULC classes in the LULC raster MUST have corresponding values in this table.**
Rain events table,"Table with 12 values of rain events, one per month. A rain event is defined as >0.1mm (USGS: http://drought.unl.edu/MonitoringTools/USRainDaysandDryDays.aspx)",".csv (Comma Separated Value) file with column names *month* and *events*; values for month are the numbers 1 through 12, corresponding to January through December."
Threshold flow accumulation,"The number of upstream cells that must flow into a cell before it is considered part of a stream, which is used to create streams from the DEM. Smaller values create more tributaries, larger values create fewer.",Integer
"alpha_m, beta_i, gamma","Model parameters used for research and calibration purposes. Default values are: alpha_m = 1/12, beta_i = 1,  gamma = 1",*alpha_m* is type string; *beta_i* and *gamma* are type floating point
