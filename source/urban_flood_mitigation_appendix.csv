Depth of rainfaill,"Depth of rainfall event of interest (mm). To calculate the design storm, users can look up intensity-frequency-duration (IFD) tables available for their city. The storm duration is equal to the average time of concentration of the studied watersheds. Time of concentration can be derived from existing studies or from web tools: eg. https://www.lmnoeng.com/Hydrology/TimeConc.php. See Balbi et al. (2017) for a detailed description of these methods."
Soil hydrologic group,"Soil groups are determined from hydraulic conductivity and soil depths. FutureWater has created a global map of hydraulic conductivity available at: http://www.futurewater.eu/2015/07/soil-hydraulic-properties/. To convert hydraulic conductivity to soil hydrologic group, Table 2 below can be used. Otherwise, look for guidance online, e.g.: http://www.bwsr.state.mn.us/outreach/eLINK/Guidance/HSG_guidance.pdf"
Biophysical table,"It is recommended to do a literature search to look for values for that are specific to the area you're working in. If these are not available, look for values that correspond as closely as possible to the same types of land cover/soil/climate. If none of these more local values are available, several general sources are recommended. Curve numbers (fields CN_A, CN_B, CN_C, CN_D) can be obtained from the USDA handbook: (NRCS-USDA, 2007 Chap. 9) For water bodies and wetlands that are connected to the stream, CN can be set to 99 (i.e. assuming that those pixels rapidly convey quickflow.) Since the focus is on potential flood effects, CN can be selected to reflect wet antecedent runoff conditions: CN values should then be converted to ARC-III conditions, as per Chapter 10 in NRCA-USDA guidelines (2007)."
Areas of interest (Subwatersheds or sewersheds ),Subwatershed can be delineated from the digital elevation model using the InVEST RouteDEM tool. Sewershed data may be available from local municipalities.
Built infrastructure (optional),Built infrastructure may be obtained from local municipalities or OpenStreetMap data
Potential damage loss for each building type (optional),"In the US, HAZUS provides damage data. For rest of the world, a recent report from the European Commission provides useful data: http://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC105688/global_flood_depth-damage_functions__10042017.pdf"
