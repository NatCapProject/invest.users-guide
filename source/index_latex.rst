.. for whatever reason, latex doesn't separate chapters if they're in the same toctree, under a subheading.
   and it's too late at this point to figure out why.
   so, this alternate index_latex file is here to use when building the pdf version of the docs
   it contains a separate subheading for each chapter.  ugh.
